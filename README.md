# star-wars-planet-crawl
- AS A   middle age human that loves starwars 
- I WANT a game I can play when I am bored that will entertain my mind and also give me a small project to create. 
- SO THAT  I can entertain myself by nerding out to Star Wars and learning how to do something new 
- GIVEN a star wars choose your own adventure game 
- WHEN I open the start screen 
- THEN I want to pick my character from a list of 3 randomized choices from swapi  
- THEN I want to pick my spacecraft from a list of 2 ships - one ship is imperial one is rebel/civilian
- THEN I want to choose a destination from a list of 3 planets
- WHEN my journey is underway 
- THEN I will be detained by a random species
- WHEN I'm detained
- THEN The species will force me to complete a task from the bored API
- WHEN the task is complete
- THEN I will reach my destination 
- THEN My choices will be stored in local storage and retold in the style of the Star Wars opening crawl
